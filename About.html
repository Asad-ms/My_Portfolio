        <div class="About-content">
            <p>Hello! I'm S. Mohammed Asad, a final-year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence, 
                driven by a deep curiosity for building meaningful and efficient technology. 
                I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and continuously seek opportunities 
                to improve my skills and contribute to impactful projects.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Over the years, I’ve developed a strong foundation in full stack development, machine learning, 
                and software engineering principles. I’ve worked on multiple academic and internship-based projects 
                where I applied my knowledge in Python, Java, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. 
                My experience also includes backend technologies like MongoDB and MySQL, 
                and I'm always looking to expand into new frameworks and tools.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I’ve completed internships that gave me real-world exposure to team collaboration, 
                agile workflows, and client-centered development. These experiences taught me how to balance performance, 
                scalability, and user experience while delivering practical solutions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Beyond technical skills, I value teamwork, clarity in communication, 
                and a strong growth mindset. Whether I’m learning a new language or mentoring peers, 
                I believe in constant evolution—both as a developer and as a person.
            </p>
